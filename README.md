# Milestone 1 
## Project Overview
In this milestone, we are going to program Nucleo-64 STM32F446/STM32F411 development board with C code to blink the LED at 1 Hz (1 second). Both of these microcontrollers from STMicroelectronics are based on ARM Cortex-M4 core with fast operations and signal-processing capabilities. To program the development board, STM32Cube is utilized as it provides the developer with the low-level drivers, and APIs. The Nucleo-64 STM32 development board comes with integrated ST-LINk. It is an in-circuit debugger and programmer for the STM32 microcontroller. In order to light up the LED, general-purpose input/output pin (GPIO) is used. It provides varies ways to interface with external circuit within an applicant framework.
