# Milestone 1 
## Project Overview
In this milestone, we are going to program Nucleo-64 STM32F411 development board with C code to blink the LED at 1 Hz (1 second). This board can be divided into two parts which are the ST-LINK part and the target MCU (Microcontroller Unit) part. In order the light up the LED, general-purpose input/output pin (GPIO) is used. It provides varies ways to interface with external circuit within an applicant framework.
